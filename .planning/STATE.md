## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Follow contact-form plugin patterns | Ensures consistency with existing SonicJS plugin conventions |
| 01-01 | Use MatchType enum (0=exact, 1=partial, 2=regex) | Database efficiency via INTEGER storage, type safety via TypeScript enum |
| 01-01 | Store timestamps in milliseconds | JavaScript Date.now() compatibility |
| 01-01 | Create separate redirect_analytics table now | Avoid future schema migration when analytics tracking is implemented (Phase 4) |
| 01-02 | Manual route mounting until auto-loading implemented | Following existing pattern in codebase |
| 02-01 | URL normalization preserves encoded characters | Prevents issues with differently-encoded equivalent URLs by not decoding URI components |
| 02-01 | Cache keys are already normalized | Caller responsible for normalization before cache ops - keeps cache logic simple |
| 02-01 | Simple cache invalidation (clear all) | Avoid cache inconsistency edge cases vs selective invalidation |
| 02-01 | 1000 entry LRU cache default | Balance memory usage (128MB Workers limit) with cache coverage |
| 02-02 | Use visited-set algorithm for circular detection | Efficient O(n) traversal of redirect chains |
| 02-02 | Return warnings (not errors) for long chains | Allows flexibility while alerting admins to potential issues |
| 02-02 | Make destination existence checking non-blocking | Network errors or 404s return warnings, don't prevent redirect creation |
